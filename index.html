					 When I volunteered as a reading camp counselor during the summer of 2014, I worked with a young girl going into the first grade. On the first day, she told me she did not know how to read and was not interested in learning; upon hearing this, I made it my goal to share my love of reading with her. On the second day, I sat with her one-on-one and helped her read Flip-A-Word books &ndash; each of the suffixes rhyme, which makes it easier for kids to practice sounding out words. I watched her smile grow while I helped her read the first few pages and she began to realize that she could learn to read. By the second book, she jumped with excitement and proclaimed, "I get it, I know how to read!" This was one of many powerful experiences I had while working with children who are first learning to read. I have fallen in love with the positive impact that librarians &ndash; who live the above example everyday &ndash; make on the world. I plan to decicate my life to spending time with people, spreading knowledge and awareness, and improving literacy skills.
